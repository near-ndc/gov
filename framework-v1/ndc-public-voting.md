# Why Public Voting makes sense for NDC

## Context

Past months was full of back and forth about fair voting:

- one human one vote,
- identity sell prevention (real thread in many identity systems), that essentially breaks the one human one vote rule,
- vote selling,
- detecting how the system can be gamed, and how we can prevent that.

Observation: NEAR account != human.
Note: that's why we build SBT ecosystem.

On the prevention side:

- establishing Fair Voting Policy,
- additional checks and rules to prevent misbehave,
- introducing an Election Integrity Commission which will be responsible for acting on misbehave,

Each prevention mechanism can introduce potential censorship. There is always a group of users who are more loud, or more empowered to make decisions, and group of users who will be always questioning everything.
Adding more "checks" will make the system more controversial and more complex. Having not enough checks, will make the system more vulnerable for voting manipulation. Not having enough community support will make the system questionable for censorship.

This problem is not solvable, there are always tradeoffs.

## Tradeoffs

The GWG treadeoffs were dictated by the Fair Voting Policy.
At the end of the day we want fair voting, rather than "manipulated" voting. The preference goes towards verified humans by their humanity check AND ecosystem check (contributions, roles ...).
Whitleblower program was introduced to incentive people who care about fair voting and don't want to see the system to be manipulated.
The trade off is to optimize for having less scam votes rather than more overall votes.

At the end of the day, the "chain" is as strong as it's ecosystem, which is built by the communities. If part of the ecosystem will try to game it, eventually this will break the communities and destroy the ecosystem.

## Private Voting

Initially, when designing the voting system we knew that eventually we will need to go to strong privacy. This is what everyone expects. However, technically we were not there yet. We would need to delay the NDC vision by many months, rather then give it a try and iterate.

## Pivotal

Seeing lot of people trying to question the whole mechanism and at the same time praise themselves as the

The goal of NDC is to be a public collective.
All these events leads me to the conclusion, that in the young, growing ecosystem, the **votes should be public**! This will **empower the community to validate the voting process**, see how the clusters and politics are being build. All of it is recorded on chain. This is the beauty of the open, public voting system: it's for public and available for anyone for analysis.

There is a lot we can learn from the NDC elections already.
